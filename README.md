Solution to the Trigram Kata

See http://codekata.com/kata/kata14-tom-swift-under-the-milkwood/ for details.

# NOTICE

This repository has been merged with https://github.com/avahe-kellenberger/trigram-express

## Purpose

This project is being constructed as part of a take-home assignment for a job application.

## Possible Future Improvements

Currently, generated text from trigrams ends as soon as there is no value mapped to a given key - This can be remedied in a number of ways, with one possible solution being to continue generation until 'X' number of words have been created.
